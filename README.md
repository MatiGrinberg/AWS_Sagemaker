# AWS_Sagemaker
Simple example on using AWS Sagemaker only to showcase my skill in it


## 1st example using a Notebook Instance
I used a common dataset to predict if a group of individuals had an income above a certain threshold.
In this project you can see how I imported the data, cleansed it, worked with libraries to interact with AWS using Python-like Boto3 and SageMaker-, uploaded data to an S3 bucket, imported the XGBoost algorithm, trained it, downloaded to the EC2 instance the reports generated from training, deployed to an endpoint, and tested its accuracy.

## 2nd example using SageMaker Studio
I created another notebook but this time using Sagemaker studio. The task is to detect fraudulent claims using again an XGBoost model for binary classification.
